# MaoZedong

## About

MaoZedong is a joke project my pals and I are doing. This discord bot sends a random Mao Zedong's quote (hence the name) onto your discord server, to inspire you, young Maoists, to continue your vigilante war with sparrows! 

## Features!

 - 150 quotes of Chairman Mao 
 - Inspiration for hours to come 
- I don't know why you even bother 

## Planned Features 
- Sources for quotes on request. 
- Scripts for reading quotes from webpages and offloading them to .xls so you can   get even more quotes!
- Permanent Revolution.

## Road map

> Finish the .xls 150 quotes database -- ~40-45% done -- [] 

> Create a base bot, posing random quotes from the .xls -- done -- [x]

> Write readme.txt and creat a GitHub page -- somewhat done -- []

> Make a batter directory and general improvements for Ux -- []

> Script for sources of quotes -- []

> Script for more quotes base on sources of quotes -- []

> Script for reading quotes from webpages and offloading them to .xls -- []

## Additional Todo
- Add a shut down function to the bot -- []
